Ground Rules for Avocado Sales Demand Forecasting

The following assumptions and considerations were applied during the analysis:

1. Data Consistency
   - Assumed all data points represent consistent and accurate weekly avocado sales figures.

2. Seasonality Consideration
   - Recognized seasonal trends (e.g., higher demand in summer months) in the forecasting model.

3. No External Influences
   - The forecast assumes no external market shocks, such as price fluctuations or supply chain issues.

4. Time Frame 
   - The forecasting was conducted based on the available historical dataset timeframe.

5. Model Limitations
   - The Triple Exponential Smoothing method is effective for short-term forecasts but may have limitations for long-term predictions.

6. Excel Constraints
   - The entire analysis was conducted using Excel, with no external statistical tools.
