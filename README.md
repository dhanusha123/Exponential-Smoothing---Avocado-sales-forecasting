# 🥑 Avocado Sales Demand Forecasting Project (U.S. Market)

This project focuses on forecasting **avocado sales demand in the United States** using advanced **time series analysis** techniques. The objective is to analyze historical sales data and apply the **Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters)** method in **Microsoft Excel** to predict future demand trends. This forecasting model helps understand seasonal variations and aids in strategic decision-making for inventory and supply chain management.
